# graphcsv.pl: converts 2-column comma-separated value input into a directed
# graph.  This isn't very well tested. See doc to convert output. Or, you
# could just change the "as_canon" last line to "as_svg" or "as_gif".  I find
# it easier to save as "canon," the text layout output, to easily test different
# layouts.  For instance, "twopi" may work better than "dot," depending.
#
# usage: graphcsv.pl < input.csv > output.canon
#
# Make sure you apply the patch below for the perl GraphViz module
