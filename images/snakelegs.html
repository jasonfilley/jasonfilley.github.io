<p>How the Snake Lost Its Legs</p>

<h1>Genesis 3 (Authorized Standard Version - 1901)</h1>

<p>Now the serpent was more
subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said unto
the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden? And
the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may
eat: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath
said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the
serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in
the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God,
knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food,
and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to
make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also
unto her husband with her, and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were
opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together,
and made themselves aprons. And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in
the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from
the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden. And Jehovah God
called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou? And he said, I heard thy
voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree,
whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? And the man said, The
woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman
said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. And Jehovah God said unto the
serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and
above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt
thou eat all the days of thy life: and I will put enmity between thee and the
woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou
shalt bruise his heel. Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain
and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire
shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. And unto Adam he said,
Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the
tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is
the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the
herb of the field; in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou
return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and
unto dust shalt thou return. And the man called his wife's name Eve; because
she was the mother of all living. And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his
wife coats of skins, and clothed them. And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is
become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his
hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever- therefore
Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from
whence he was taken. So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the
garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way,
to keep the way of the tree of life.</p>

<h1>Gospel of St. Barnabus</h1>

<h2>The Fall of Man</h2>

<p>39. Then said John: &quot;Well have you
spoken, O master, but we lack to know how man sinned through pride.&quot; Jesus
answered: &quot;When God has expelled Satan, and the angel Gabriel had purified
that mass of earth whereon Satan spat, God created everything that lives, both
of the animals that fly and of them that walk and swim, and he adorned the
world with all that it has. One day Satan approached to the gates of paradise,
and, seeing the horses eating grass, he announced to them that if that mass of
earth should receive a soul there would be for them
grievous labour; and that therefore it would be to their advantage to trample
that piece of earth in such wise that it should be no more good for anything.</p>

<p>The horses aroused themselves and impetuously
set themselves to run over that piece of earth which lay among lilies and
roses;. Whereupon God gave spirit to that unclean portion of earth upon which
lay the spittle of Satan, which Gabriel had taken up from the mass; and raised
up the dog, who, barking, filled the horses with fear, and they fled. Then God
gave his soul to man, while all the holy angels sang: &quot;Blessed be your
holy name, O God our Lord.&quot; &quot;Adam, having sprung upon his feet, saw
in the air a writing that shone like the sun;, which said:
&quot;There is only one God, and Muhammad is the Messenger of God.&quot;</p>

<p>Whereupon Adam opened his mouth and said:
&quot;I thank you, O Lord my God, that you have deigned to create me; but tell
me. I pray you, what means the message of these words: &quot;Muhammad is
Messenger of God. Have there been other men before me?&quot; 'Then said God:
&quot;Be you welcome, O my servant Adam. I tell you that you are the first man
whom I have created. And he whom you have seen [mentioned] is your son, who
shall come into the world many years hence, and shall be my Messenger, for whom
I have created all things; who shall give light to the world when he shall come; whose soul was set in a celestial splendour
;sixty thousand years before I made any. thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Adam besought God, saying: &quot;Lord, grant
me this writing upon the nails of the fingers of my hands.&quot; Then God gave
to the first man upon his thumbs that writing; upon the thumb-nail of the right
hand it said: &quot;There is only one God;,&quot; and upon the thumb-nail of
the left it said: &quot;Muhammad is Messenger ;of God.&quot; Then with fatherly
affection the first man kissed those words, and rubbed his eyes, and said:
&quot;Blessed be that day when you shall come to the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing the man alone, God said: &quot;It is
not well that he should remain alone.&quot; Wherefore he made him to sleep, and
took a rib from near his heart, filling the place with flesh. * Of that rib
made he Eve, and gave her to Adam for his wife. He set the twain of them as
lords of Paradise, to whom he said: &quot;Behold I give to you every fruit to
eat, except the apples and the corn&quot; whereof he said: &quot;Beware that in
no wise you eat of these fruits, for you shall become unclean, insomuch that I
shall not suffer. you to remain here, but shall drive you forth, and you shall
suffer great miseries.&quot;</p>

<h2>The Temptation of Eve</h2>

<p>40. When Satan had knowledge of this he
became mad with indignation, and so he drew near to the gate of paradise where
a horrid serpent with legs like a camel, and nails on his feet [that] cut like
a razor on every side, stood on guard. The enemy said to him: 'Let me to enter
into paradise.'</p>

<p>The serpent answered: 'How shall I let you
enter [since] God has commanded me to cast you out?' Satan answered: 'You see
how much God loves you; he has set you outside of paradise to keep guard over a
lump of clay, which is man! If you bring me into paradise I will make you so
terrible that every one shall flee you, and so you shall go and stay at your
pleasure.' Then the serpent said: 'And how shall I set you within [paradise]?'</p>

<p>Satan said, 'You are great: therefore, open your
mouth, and I will enter into your belly, and so [when] you enter into paradise
[you] shall place me near to those two lumps of clay that are newly walking
upon the earth.' Then the serpent did so, and placed Satan near Eve, for Adam,
her husband, was sleeping. Satan presented himself before the woman like a
beauteous angel, and said to her: 'Why do you not eat of those apples and
corn?' Eve answered: 'Our God has said to us that [if we] eat [them] we shall
be unclean, and he will drive us from paradise.'</p>

<p>Satan answered: 'He does not speak the truth!
You must know that God is wicked and envious, and suffers no equals, but keeps
every one as a slave. [This is] why he has said this [to you]; in order that
you may not become equal to him. But if you and your companion do according to
my counsel, you shall eat of those fruits as [you eat] of the other [fruits],
and you shall not remain subject to others but like God you shall know good and
evil, and you shall do whatever you please, because you shall be equal to God.'</p>

<p>Then Eve took and ate of those [fruits], and
when her husband awoke she told [him everything] that Satan had said; and he
took and ate the fruit [when] his wife offered them to him. But, as the food
was going down, he remembered the words of God, and, wishing to stop the food,
he put his hand into his throat, where every man has the mark.</p>

<h2>The Expulsion from Paradise</h2>

<p>41. Then both of them knew that they were
naked, and, being ashamed, they took fig leaves and made a clothing for their
secret parts. When midday was passed, God appeared to them, and called Adam,
saying: 'Adam, where are you?' He answered: 'Lord, I hid myself from your
presence because my wife and I are naked, and so we are ashamed to present
ourselves before you.' Then God said: 'And who has robbed you of your
innocence, unless you have eaten the fruit [that makes you] unclean, and will
not be able to abide [any] longer in paradise?'</p>

<p>Adam answered: 'O Lord, the wife whom you
have given me [urged] me to eat [it] and so I have eaten it.' Then God said to
the woman: 'Why did you give [this] food to your husband?' Eve answered: 'Satan
deceived me, and so I ate [the fruit].' 'And how did that reprobate enter into
[the garden]?' said God. Eve answered: 'A serpent that stands at the northern gate
brought him near to me.'</p>

<p>Then God said to Adam: 'Because you have
[listened to] your wife and have eaten the fruit, cursed be the earth in your
works; it shall bring forth brambles and thorns for you, and you shall eat
bread by the sweat of your face. Remember that you are earth, and to earth you
return.' And he spoke to Eve, saying: 'And you who did [listen] to Satan, and
gave the food to your husband, shall abide under the dominion of man, who shall
keep you as a slave, and you shall bear children with travail.'</p>

<p>And having called the serpent, God called the
angel Michael, who holds the sword of God, [and] said: 'First drive this wicked
serpent forth from paradise, and when outside cut off his legs: for if he wants
to walk, he must trail his body upon the earth.' Afterwards God called Satan,
who came laughing, and he said to him: 'Because you, reprobate, have deceived
[Adam and Eve] and have made them unclean, I will that every uncleanness [from] them and
[from] all their children - [of which] they shall be truly penitent and shall
serve me - in going forth from their body shall enter through your mouth, and
so shall you be satiated with uncleanness.'</p>

<p>Satan then gave a horrible roar, and said:
'Since you will to make me [continually] worse, I will make me that which I
shall be able!' Then said God: 'Depart, cursed one, from my presence!' Then
Satan departed, and God said to Adam [and] Eve, who were both weeping: 'Go
forth from paradise, and do penance, and do not let your hope fail, for I will
send your son so that your seed shall lift the dominion of Satan from off the
human race: for I will give all things to he who shall come, my Messenger.'</p>

<p>God hid himself [from Adam and Eve], and the
angel Michael drove them forth from paradise. Then, Adam, turning around, saw
written above the gate, There is only one God, and Muhammad is Messenger of
God. Weeping, he said: 'May it be pleasing to God, O my son, that you come
quickly and draw us out of misery.' And thus,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;Satan and
Adam sinned through pride, the one by despising man, the other by wishing to
make himself equal with God.&quot;</p>

<h1>Targum Pseudo-Jonathan</h1>

<p>&quot;Then the Lord God
brought the three of them to judgment, and he said to the serpent,
&quot;Because you have done this, cursed are you above all cattle, and above
all beasts of the field. Upon your belly you shall go about, and your feet
shall be cut off, and you will cast off your skin once every seven years, and
the poison of death will be in your mouth, and you shall eat dust all the days
of your life.&quot;</p>

<p><a

<h1>Josephus</h1>

<p>God therefore commanded that Adam and his
wife should eat of all the rest of the plants, but to abstain from the tree of
knowledge; and foretold to them, that if they touched it, it would prove their
destruction. But while all the living creatures had one language, (5) at that
time the serpent, which then lived together with Adam and his wife, shewed an
envious disposition, at his supposal of their living happily, and in obedience
to the commands of God; and imagining, that when they disobeyed them, they
would fall into calamities, he persuaded the woman, out of a malicious intention,
to taste of the tree of knowledge, telling them, that in that tree was the
knowledge of good and evil; which knowledge, when they should obtain, they
would lead a happy life; nay, a life not inferior to that of a god: by which
means he overcame the woman, and persuaded her to despise the command of God.
Now when she had tasted of that tree, and was pleased with its fruit, she
persuaded Adam to make use of it also. Upon this they perceived that they were
become naked to one another; and being ashamed thus to appear abroad, they
invented somewhat to cover them; for the tree sharpened their understanding;
and they covered themselves with fig-leaves; and tying these before them, out
of modesty, they thought they were happier than they were before, as they had
discovered what they were in want of. But when God came into the garden, Adam,
who was wont before to come and converse with him, being conscious of his
wicked behavior, went out of the way. This behavior surprised God; and he asked
what was the cause of this his procedure; and why he, that before delighted in
that conversation, did now fly from it, and avoid it. When he made no reply, as
conscious to himself that he had transgressed the command of God, God said,
&quot;I had before determined about you both, how you might lead a happy life,
without any affliction, and care, and vexation of soul; and that all things
which might contribute to your enjoyment and pleasure should grow up by my
providence, of their own accord, without your own labor and pains-taking; which
state of labor and pains-taking would soon bring on old age, and death would
not be at any remote distance: but now thou hast abused this my good-will, and
hast disobeyed my commands; for thy silence is not the sign of thy virtue, but
of thy evil conscience.&quot; However, Adam excused his sin, and entreated God
not to be angry at him, and laid the blame of what was done upon his wife; and
said that he was deceived by her, and thence became an offender; while she
again accused the serpent. But God allotted him punishment, because he weakly
submitted to the counsel of his wife; and said the ground should not henceforth
yield its fruits of its own accord, but that when it should be harassed by
their labor, it should bring forth some of its fruits, and refuse to bring
forth others. He also made Eve liable to the inconveniency of breeding, and the
sharp pains of bringing forth children; and this because she persuaded Adam
with the same arguments wherewith the serpent had persuaded her, and had
thereby brought him into a calamitous condition. He also deprived the serpent
of speech, out of indignation at his malicious disposition towards Adam.
Besides this, he inserted poison under his tongue, and made him an enemy to
men; and suggested to them, that they should direct their strokes against his
head, that being the place wherein lay his mischievous designs towards men, and
it being easiest to take vengeance on him, that way. And when he had deprived
him of the use of his feet, he made him to go rolling all along, and dragging
himself upon the ground. And when God had appointed these penalties for them,
he removed Adam and Eve out of the garden into another place.</p>

<p>When the Holy One, blessed be

descended and cut off his hands and feet, and his cries resounded from one end

downfall of Egypt, and is itself illumined thereby, viz., &quot;The cry thereof

The Almighty said to the serpent: &quot;Thou hast caused people to follow their
dead prostrate with grief, therefore thou too, <em>upon they belly shalt thou go</em>.&quot;
R. Eliezer observed: Even in God's curse there is a blessing: had He not

animals created, and in form it resembled man closely. It stood upright, and
was of extraordinary size. Afterward, it lost the mental advantages it had
possessed as compared with other animals, and it degenerated physically, too;
it was deprived of its feet, so that it could not pursue other animals and kill
them.</p>

<h1>Alphabet of Rabbi Akiba; T.S. 3, 91.</h1>

<p>Then the Holy One, blessed be He,

upon thy belly shalt thou go.&quot;</em> Upon hearing his doom the serpent
answered: &quot;Sovereign of the universe! If so be Thy will, then let me be
like the fish in the sea which have no feet.&quot; Now, when He added, <em>and
dust shalt thou eat</em>, the serpent rejoined: &quot;Sovereign of the Universe!
If the fish eat dust, then must I too eat dust.&quot; Thereupon God seized him
and slithered his tongue in two and addressed him thus: &quot;Miserable wretch!
The first to display an evil tongue; therefore I make it known to all that it
was thine own tongue which brought this evil upon thee.&quot;</p>

<h1>The Epic of Gilgamesh</h1>

<p>When Gilgamesh heard this he
opened the sluices so that a sweet-water current might carry him out to the
deepest channel; he tied heavy stones to his feet and they dragged him down to
the water-bed. There he saw the plant growing; although it pricked him he took
it in his hands; then he cut the heavy stones from his feet, and the sea
carried him and threw him on to the shore. Gilgamesh said to Urshanabi the
ferryman, &quot;Come here, and see this marvellous plant. By its virtue a man
may win back all his former strength. I will take it to Uruk of the strong
walls; there I will give it to the old men to eat. Its name shall be &quot;The
Old Men Are Young Again&quot;; and at last I shall eat it myself and have back
all my lost youth.' So Gilgamesh returned by the gate through which he had
come, Gilgamesh and Urshanabi went together. They travelled their twenty
leagues and then they broke their fast; after thirty leagues they stopped for
the night.</p>

<p>Gilgamesh saw a well of cool
water and he went down and bathed; but deep in the pool there was lying a
serpent, and the serpent sensed the sweetness of the flower. It rose out of the
water and snatched it away, and immediately it sloughed its skin and returned
to the well. Then Gilgamesh sat down and wept, the tears ran down his face, and
he took the hand of Urshanabi; 'O Urshanabi, was it for this that I toiled with
my hands, is it for this I have wrung out my heart's blood? For myself I have
gained nothing; not I, but the beast of the earth has joy of it now. Already
the stream has carried it twenty leagues back to the channels where I found it.
I found a sign and now I have lost it. Let us leave the boat on the bank and
go.</p>

<h2>Chapter II- The Fall of Man</h2>

<h3>The Narrative in Genesis</h3>

<h4>The narrative of the Fall of Man in Genesis</h4>

<p>With a few light but masterly strokes the
Jehovistic writer depicts for us the blissful life of our first parents in the
happy garden which God had created for their abode. There every tree that was
pleasant to the sight and good for food grew abundantly; there the animals
lived at peace with man and with each other; there man and woman knew no shame,
because they knew no ill: it was the age of innocence. But this glad time was
short, the sunshine was soon clouded. From his description of the creation of
Eve and her introduction to Adam, the writer passes at once to tell the sad
story of their fall, their loss of innocence, their expulsion from Eden, and
the doom of labour, of sorrow, and of death pronounced on them and their posterity.
In the midst of the garden grew the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and
God had forbidden man to eat of its fruit, saying, &quot;In the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.&quot; But the serpent was cunning, and
the woman weak and credulous: he persuaded her to eat of the fatal fruit and
she gave of it to her husband, and he ate also. No sooner had they tasted it
than the eyes of both of them were opened, they knew that they were naked, and
filled with shame and confusion they hid their nakedness under aprons of
fig-leaves: the age of innocence was gone for ever. That woeful day, when the
heat of noon was over and the shadows were growing long in the garden, God
walked there, as was his wont, in the cool of the evening. The man and woman heard
his footsteps [footnote: Genesis iii.8, &quot;they heard the sound of the Lord
God walking in the garden.&quot; The &quot;sound&quot; is clearly that of his
footsteps, not of his voice, as the English version translates it. The Hebrew
word for sound () is ambiguous; it may signify either &quot;sound&quot; or
&quot;voice.&quot;], perhaps the rustling of the fallen leaves (if leaves could
fall in Eden) under his tread, and they hid behind the trees, ashamed to be
seen by him naked. But he called them forth from the thicket, and learning from
the abashed couple how they had disobeyed his command by eating of the tree of
knowledge, he flew into a towering passion. He cursed the serpent, condemning
him to go on his belly, to eat dust, and to be the enemy of mankind all the
days of his life: he cursed the ground, condemning it to bring forth thorns and
thistles: he cursed the woman, condemning her to bear children in sorrow and to
be in subjection to her husband: he cursed the man, condemning him to wring his
daily bread from the ground in the sweat of his brow, and finally to return to
the dust out of which he had been taken. Having relieved his feelings by these
copious maledictions, the irascible but really kind-hearted deity relented so
far as to make coats of skins for the culprits to replace their scanty aprons
of fig-leaves, and clad in these new garments the shamefaced pair retreated
among the trees; while in the west the sunset died away, and the shadows
deepened on Paradise Lost. [Footnote: Genesis iii.]</p>


<h4>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life.</h4>

<p>In this account everything hinges on the tree
of the knowledge of good and evil: it occupies, so to say, the centre of the
stage in the great tragedy, with the man and woman and the talking serpent
grouped round it. But when we look closer we perceive a second tree standing
side by side with the other in the midst of the garden. It is a very remarkable
tree, for it is no less than the tree of life, whose fruit confers immortality
on all who eat of it. Yet in the actual story of the fall this wonderful tree
plays no part. Its fruit hangs there on the boughs ready to be plucked; unlike
the tree of knowledge, it is hedged about by no divine prohibition, yet no one
thinks it worth while to taste of the luscious fruit and live for ever. The
eyes of the actors are all turned on the tree of knowledge; they appear not to
see the tree of life. Only, when all is over, does God bethink himself of the
wondrous tree standing there neglected, with all its infinite possibilities, in
the midst of the garden; and fearing lest man, who has become like him in
knowledge by eating of the one tree, should become like him in immortality by
eating of the other, he drives him from the garden and sets an angelic
squadron, with flaming swords, to guard the approach to the tree of life, that
none henceforth may eat of its magic fruit and live for ever. Thus, while
throughout the moving tragedy in Eden our attention is fixed exclusively on the
tree of knowledge, in the great transformation scene at the end, where the
splendours of Eden fade for ever into the light of common day, the last glimpse
we catch of the happy garden shows the tree of life alone lit up by the lurid
gleam of brandished angelic falchions [Footnote: Genesis iii. 22-24.]</p>


<h4>We may suppose that in the original form of the narrative there were two
trees, a Tree of Life and a Tree of Death, and that man was allowed to eat of
the Tree of Life but forbidden to eat of the Tree of Death.</h4>

<p>It appears to be generally recognized that some
confusion has crept into the account of the two trees and that in the original
story the tree of life did not play the purely passive and spectacular part
assigned to it in the existing narrative. Accordingly, some have thought that
there were originally two different stories of the fall, in one of which the
tree of knowledge figured alone, and in the other the tree of life alone, and
that the two stories have been unskillfully fused into a single narrative by an
editor, who has preserved the one nearly intact, while he has clipped and pared
the other almost past recognition. [Footnote: J. Skinner, Critical and
Exegetical Commentary on Genesis (Edinburgh, 1910), pp 52 sq., 94.] It may be
so, but perhaps the solution of the problem is to be sought in another
direction. The gist of the whole story of the fall appears to be an attempt to
explain man's mortality, to set forth how death came into the world. It is true
that man is not said to have been created immortal and to have lost his
immortality through disobedience; but neither is he said to have been created
mortal. Rather we are given to understand that the possibility alike of
immortality and of mortality was open to him, and that it rested with him which
he would choose; for the tree of life stood within his reach, its fruit was not
forbidden to him, he had only to stretch out his hand, take of the fruit, and
eating of it live for ever. Indeed, far from being prohibited to eat of the
tree of life, man was implicitly permitted, if not encouraged, to partake of it
by his Creator, who had told him expressly, that he might eat freely of every
tree in the garden, with the single exception of the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil. [Footnote: Genesis ii. 16 sq., &quot;And the Lord God commanded
the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the
day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.&quot;] Thus by planting the
tree of life in the garden and not prohibiting its use, God apparently intended
to give man the option, or at least the chance, of immortality, but man missed
his chance by electing to eat of the other tree, which God had warned him not
to touch under pain of immediate death. This suggests that the forbidden tree
was really a tree of death, not of knowledge, and that the mere taste of its
deadly fruit, quite apart from any question of obedience or disobedience to a
divine command, sufficed to entail death on the eater. There inference is entirely
in keeping with God's warning to man, &quot;Thou shalt not eat of it: for in
the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.&quot; [Footnote:
Genesis ii. 17] Accordingly we may suppose that in the original story there
were two trees, a tree of life and a tree of death; that it was open to man to
eat of the one and live for ever, or to eat of the other and die; that God, out
of good will to his creature, advised man to eat of the tree of life and warned
him not to eat of the tree of death; and that man, misled by the serpent, ate
of the wrong tree and so forfeited the immortality which his benevolent Creator
had designed for him.</p>

<h4>This hypothesis sets the character of the Creator in a more amiable
light by making it probable that he intended to confer to boon of immortality
on his creature man, and was only frustrated in his amiable intention by the
cunning of the serpent.</h4>

<p>At least this hypothesis has the advantage of
restoring the balance between the two trees and of rendering the whole
narrative clear, simple, and consistent. It dispenses with the necessity of
assuming two original and distinct stories which have been clumsily stitched
together by a botching editor. But the hypothesis is further recommended by
another and deeper consideration. It sets the character of the Creator in a far
more amiable light: it clears him entirely of that suspicion of envy and
jealousy, not to say malignity and cowardice, which, on the strength of the
narrative in Genesis, has so long rested like a dark blot on his reputation.
For according to that narrative, God grudge man the possession both of
knowledge and of immortality; he desired to keep these good things to himself,
and feared that if man got one or both of them, he would be the equal of his
maker, a thing not to be suffered at any price. Accordingly he forbade man to
eat of the tree of knowledge, and when man disregarded the command, the deity
hustled him out of the garden and closed the premises, to prevent him from
eating of the other tree and so becoming immortal. The motive was mean, and the
conduct despicable. More than that, both the one and the other are utterly
inconsistent with the previous behaviour of the deity, who, far from grudging
man anything, had done all in his power to make him happy and comfortable, by
creating a beautiful garden for his delectation, beasts and birds to play with,
and a woman to be his wife. Surely it is far more in harmony both with the
tenor of the narrative and with the goodness of the Creator to suppose, that he
intended to crown his kindness to man by conferring on him the boon of
immortality, and that his benevolent intention was only frustrated by the wiles
of the serpent.</p>

<h4>In the original narrative the serpent's motive for beguiling the woman
was probably to cheat men of the boon of immortality and to confer it on
serpents, which are commonly supposed to be immortal, because they cast their
skins and thereby renew their youth.</h4>

<p>But we have still to ask, why should the
serpent practise this deceit on man? What motive had he for depriving the human
race of the great privilege which the Creator had planned for them? Was his
interference purely officious? Or had he some deep design behind it? To these
questions the narrative in Genesis furnishes no answer. The serpent gains
nothing by his fraud; on the contrary he loses, for he is cursed by God and
condemned thenceforth to crawl on his belly and lick the dust. But perhaps his
conduct was not so wholly malignant and purposeless as appears on the surface.
We are told that he was more subtle than any beast of the field; did he really
show his sagacity by blasting man's prospects without improving his own? We may
suspect that in the original story he justified his reputation by appropriating
to himself the blessing of which he deprived our species; in fact, that while
he persuaded our first parents to eat of the tree of death, he himself ate of
the tree of life and so lived for ever. The supposition is not so extravagant
as it may seem. In not a few savage stories of the origin of death, which I
will relate immediately, we read that serpents contrived to outwit or
intimidate man and so to secure for themselves the immortality which was meant
for him; for many savages believe that by annually casting their skins serpents
and other animals renew their youth and live for ever. The belief appears to
have been shared by the Semites; for, according to the ancient Phoenician
writer Sanchuniathon, the serpent was the longest-lived of all animals, because
it cast its skin and so renewed its youth. [Footnote: Sanchuniathon, quoted by
Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelii, i. 10, και πολυζρονιωτατον δε εστιν ου μονον τω εκδυομενον το γηρας νεαζειν - Here
γηρας is used in the sense of &quot;old or cast skin,&quot; as in Aristotle,
Histor. Animal. Vii. 18 (vol. I. Pp. 600a-601b, of Im. Bekker's Berlin
edition), who discusses the subject at length. The use of γηρας (&quot;old age&quot;) in the sense of &quot;cast skin&quot; is a clear
indication that the Greeks shared the widespread belief in the renewal of an
animal's youth by the casting of its skin.] But if the Phoenicians held this
view of the serpent's longevity and the cause of it, their neighbours and
kinsfolk the Hebrews may well have done the same. Certainly the Hebrews seem to
have thought that eagles renew their youth by moulting their feathers;
[Footnote: Psalm ciii. 5, &quot;They youth is renewed like the eagle.&quot; The
commentators rightly explain the belief in the renewal of the eagles youth by
the moulting of its feathers. Compare J. Morgenstern, &quot;On Gilgames-Epic,
xi. 274-320,&quot; Zeitschrift fur Assyriologie, xxix. (1915) p. 294,
&quot;Baethgen quotes a tradition from Bar Hebraeus, that when the eagle grows
old he casts off his feathers and clothes himself with new ones. Rashi,
commenting on this same verse, is even more specific. He says that from year to
year the eagle casts off his old wings and feathers and puts on new, and
thereby renews his youth constantly.&quot; Strictly speaking, the bird referred
to in this passage of the Psalms ( ) is not the eagle but the great
griffon-vulture, which abounds in Palestine. See H. B.. Tristram, The Natural
History of the Bible, Ninth Edition (London, 1898), pp. 172 sqq.] and if so,
why not serpents by casting their skins? Indeed, the notion that the serpent
cheated man of immortality by getting possession of a life-giving plant which
the higher powers had destined for our species, occurs in the famous Gilgamesh
epic, on of the oldest literary monuments of the Semitic race and far more
ancient than Genesis. In it we read how the deified Ut-napishtim revealed to the
hero Gilgamesh the existence of a plant which had the miraculous power of
renewing youth and bore the name &quot;the old man becomes young&quot;; how
Gilgamesh procured the plant and boasted that he would eat of it and so renew
his lost youth; how, before he could do so, a serpent stole the magic plant
from him, while he was bathing in the cool water of a well or brook;; and how,
bereft of the hope of immortality, Gilgamesh sat down and wept. [Footnote: P.
Jensen, Assyrisch-Babylonische Mythen und Epen (Berlin, 1900), pp. 251 sqq.; R.
F. Harper, Assyrian and Babylonian Literature (New York, 1901), pp. 361 sq.; P.
Dhorme, Choix de Textes Religieux Assyro-Babyloniens (Paris, 1907), pp. 311
sqq.; A. Ungnad und H. Gressmann, Das Gilgamesch-Epos (Gottingen, 1911), pp. 62
sq.; L.W. King, Babylonian Religion and Magic (London, 1899), pp. 13 sq. The
first, so far as I know, to point out the parallelism between this passage and
the narrative in Genesis was Rabbie Julian Morgenstern. See his instructive
article, &quot;On Gilgames-Epic, xi. 274-320,&quot; Zeitschrift fur
Assyriologie, xxix. (1915) p. 284 sqq.] It is true that nothing is here said
about the serpent eating the plant and so obtaining immortality for himself;
but the omission may be due merely to the state of the text, which is obscure
and defective, and even if the poet were silent on this point, the parallel
versions of the story, which I shall cite, enable us to supply the lacuna with
a fair degree of probability. These parallels further suggest, though they
cannot prove, that in the original of the story, which the Jehovistic writer
has mangled and distorted, the serpent was the messenger sent by God to bear
the glad tidings of immortality to man, but that the cunning creature perverted
the message to the advantage of his species and to the ruin of ours. The gift
of speech, which he used to such ill purpose, was lent him in his capacity of
ambassador from God to man.</p>

<h4>The story of the Fall of Man in its original form as an explanation of
the origin of death.</h4>

<p>To sum up, if we may judge from a comparison
of the versions dispersed among many peoples, the true original story of the
Fall of Man ran somewhat as follows. The benevolent Creator, after modelling
the first man and woman out of mud and animating them by the simple process of
blowing into their mouths and noses, placed the happy pair in an earthly
paradise, where, free from care and toil, they could live on the sweet fruits
of a delightful garden, and where birds and beasts frisked about them in
fearless security. As a crowning mercy he planned for our first parents the
great gift of immortality, but resolved to make them the arbiters of their own
fate by leaving them free to accept or reject the proffered boon. For that
purpose he planted in the midst of the garden two wondrous trees that bore
fruits of very different sorts, the fruit of the one being fraught with death
to the eater and the other with life eternal. Having done so, he sent the
serpent to the man and woman and charged him to deliver this message: &quot;Eat
not of the Tree of Death, for in the day ye eat thereof ye shall surely die;
but eat of the Tree of Life and live for ever.&quot; Now the serpent was more
subtle than any beast of the field, and on his way he bethought him of changing
the message; so when he came to the happy garden and found the woman alone in
it, he said to her, &quot;Thus saith God: Eat not of the Tree of Life, for in
the day ye eat thereof ye shall surely die; but eat of the Tree of Death, and
live for ever.&quot; The foolish woman believed him, and at of the fatal fruit,
and gave of it to her husband, and he ate also. But the sly serpent himself ate
of the Tree of Life. That is why men have been mortal and serpents immortal
ever since, for serpents cast their skins every year and so renew their youth.
If only the serpent had not perverted God's good messages and deceived our
first mother, we should have been immortal instead of the serpents; for like
the serpents we should have cast our skins every year and so renewed our youth
perpetually.</p>

<p>That this, or something like this, was the
original form of the story is made probable by a comparison of the following
tales, which may conveniently be arranged under two heads, &quot;The Story of
the Perverted Message&quot; and &quot;The Story of the Cast Skin.&quot;</p>

<h3>The Story of the Perverted Message</h3>

<h4>Hottentot story of the origin of death: the Moon and the hare.</h4>

<p>Like many other savages, the Namaquas or
Hottentots associate the phases of the moon with the idea of immorality, the
apparent waning and waxing of the luminary being understood by them as a real
process of alternate disintegration and reintegration, of decay and growth
repeated perpetually. Even the rising and setting of the moon is interpreted by
them as its birth and death. [Footnote: C.J. Andersson, Lake Ngami, Second
Edition (London, 1856), p. 328 note 1, &quot;When speaking of the moon the
Namaquas do not say, like ourselves, that it rises and sets, but that ‘it dies
and is born again.'&quot;] They say that once on a time the Moon wished to send
to mankind a message of immortality, and the hare undertook to act as
messenger. So the Moon charged him to go to men and say, &quot;As I die and
rise to life again, so shall you die and rise to life again.&quot; Accordingly
the hare went to men, but either out of forgetfulness or malice he reversed the
message and said, &quot;As I die and do not rise to life again, so you shall
also die and not rise to life again.&quot; Then he went back to the Moon, and
she asked him what he had said. He told her, and when she heard how he had
given the wrong message, she was so angry that she threw a stick at him which
split his lip. That is why the hare's lip is still cloven. So the hare ran away
and is still running to this day. Some people, however, say that before he fled
he clawed the Moon's face, which still bears the marks of the scratching, as
anybody may see for himself on a clear moonlight night. But the Namaquas are
still angry with the hare for robbing them of immortality. The old men of the
tribe used to say, &quot;We are still enraged with the hare, because he brought
such a bad message, and we will not eat him.&quot; Hence from the day when a
youth comes of age and takes his place among the men, he is forbidden to eat
hare's flesh, or even to come into contact with a fire on which a hare has been
cooked. If a man breaks the rule, he is not infrequently banished the village.
However, on the payment of a fine he may be readmitted to the community.

Africa (London, 1838), i. 169; C. J. Andersson, Lake Ngami, Second Edition

<h4>Bushman story of the origin of death: the Moon and the hare.</h4>

<p>A similar tale, with some minor differences,
is told by the Bushmen. According to them, the Moon formerly said to men,
&quot;As I die and come to life again, so shall ye do; when ye die, ye shall
not die altogether but shall rise again.&quot; But one man would not believe
the glad tidings of immortality, and he would not consent to hold his tongue.
For his mother had die, he loudly lamented her, and nothing could persuade him
that she would come to life again. A heated altercation ensued between him and
the Moon on this painful subject. &quot;Your mother's asleep,&quot; says the
Moon. &quot;She's dead,&quot; says the man, and at it they went again, hammer
and tongs, till at last the Moon lost patience and struck the man on the face
with her fist, cleaving his mouth with the blow. And as she did so, she cursed
him saying, &quot;His mouth shall be always like this, even when he is a hare.
For a hare he shall be. He shall spring away, he shall come doubling back. The
dogs shall chase him, and when they have caught him they shall tear him in
pieces. He shall altogether die. And all men, when they die, shall die
outright. For he would not agree with me, when I bid him not to weep for his
mother, for she would live again. ‘No,' says he to me, ‘my mother will not live
again.' Therefore he shall altogether become a hare. And the people, they shall
altogether die, because he contradicted me flat when I told him that the people
would do as I do, returning to life after they were dead.&quot; So a righteous
retribution overtook the sceptic for his scepticism, for he was turned into a
hare, and a hare he has been ever since. But still he has human flesh in his
thigh, and that is why, when the Bushmen kill a hare, they will not eat that
portion of the thigh, but cut it out, because it is human flesh. And still the
Bushmen say, &quot;It was on account of the hare that the Moon cursed us, so
that we die altogether. If it had not been for him, we should have come to life
again when we died. But he would not believe what the Moon told him, he
contradicted her flat.&quot; [Footnote: W. H. I. Bleek and L. C. Lloyd,
Specimens of Bushman Folklore (London, 1911), pp. 57-65. The part of the hare's
thigh which the Bushmen cut out is believed to be the musculus biceps femoris.]
In this Bushman version of the story the hare is not the animal messenger of
God to men, but a human sceptic who for doubting the gospel of eternal life, is
turned into a hare and involves the whole human race in the doom of mortality.
This may be an older form of the story than the Hottentot version, in which the
hare is a hare and nothing more.</p>

<h4>Nandi story of the origin of death: the Moon and the dog.</h4>

<p>The Nandi of British East Africa tell a story
in which the origin of death is referred to the ill-humour of a dog, who
brought the tidings of immortality to men, but, not being received with the
deference due to so august an embassy, he changed his tune in a huff and doomed
mankind to the sad fate to which they have ever since been subject. The story
runs thus. When the first en lived upon the earth, a dog came to them one day
and said, &quot;All people will die like the Moon, but unlike the Moon you will
not return to life again unless you give me some milk to drink out of your
gourd and beer to drink through your straw. If you do this, I will arrange for
you to go to the river when you die and to come to life again on the third
day.&quot; But the people laughed at the dog, and gave him some milk and beer
to drink off a stool. The dog was angry at not being served in the same vessels
as a human being, and thought he put his pride in his pocket and drank the milk
and beer from the stool, he went away in high dudgeon, saying, &quot;All people
will die, and the Moon alone will return to life.&quot; That is why, when
people die, they stay away, whereas when the Moon goes away she comes back
again after three days' absence. If only people had given that dog a gourd to
drink milk out of, and a straw to suck beer through, we should all have risen
from the dead, like the moon, after three days. [A. C. Hollis, The Nandi
(Oxford, 1909), p. 98] In this story nothing is said as to the personage who
sent the dog with the message of immortality to men; but from the messenger's
reference to the moon, and from a comparison with the parallel Hottentot story,
we may reasonably infer that it was the Moon who employed the dog to run the
errand, and the unscrupulous animal misused his opportunity to extort
privileges for himself to which he was not strictly entitled.</p>

<h4>Hottentot story of the origin of death: the Moon, the insect, and the
hare.</h4>

<p>In these stories a single messenger is
engaged to carry the momentous message, and the fatal issue of the mission is
set down to the carelessness or malice of the missionary. However, in some
narratives of the origin of death, two messengers are dispatched, and the cause
of death is said to have been the dilatoriness or misconduct of the messenger
who bore the glad tidings of immortality. There is a Hottentot story of the
origin of death which is cast in this form. They say that once the Moon sent an
insect to men with this message, &quot;Go thou to men and tell them, ‘As I die,
and dying live, so ye shall also die, and dying live.'&quot; The insect set off
with this message, but as he crawled along, the hare came leaping after him,
and stopping beside him asked, &quot;On what errand art thou bound?&quot; The
insect answered, &quot;I am sent by the Moon to men, to tell them that as she
dies, and dying lives, they also shall die, and dying live.&quot; The hare
said, &quot;As thou art an awkward runner, le me go.&quot; And away he tore with
the message, while the insect came creeping slowly behind. When he came to men,
the hare perverted the message which he had officiously taken upon himself to
deliver, for he said, &quot;I am sent by the Moon to tell you, ‘As I die, and
dying perish, in the same manner ye shall also die and come wholly to an
end.'&quot; Then the hare returned to the Moon, and told her what he had said
to men. The Moon was very angry and reproached the hare, saying, &quot;Darest
thou tell the people a thing which I have not said?&quot; With that she took a
stick and hit him over the nose. That is why the hare's nose is slit down to
this day. [Footnote: W. H. I. Bleek, Reynard the Fox in South Africa (London,
1864), pp.. 69 sq.]</p>

<h4>Tati Bushman story of the origin of death: the Moon, the tortoise, and
the hare.</h4>

<p>The same tale is told, with some slight
variations, by the Tati Bushmen or Masarwas, who inhabit the Bechuanaland
Protectorate, the Kalahari desert, and portions of Southern Rhodesia. The men
of old time, they say, told this story. The Moon wished to send a message to
the men of the early race, to tell them that as she died and came to life
again, so they would die, and dying come to life again. So the Moon called the
tortoise and said to him, &quot;Go over to those men there, and give them this
message from me. Tell them that as I dying live, so they dying will live
again.&quot; Now the tortoise was very slow, and he kept repeating the message
to himself, so as not to forget it. The Moon was very vexed with his slowness
and with his forgetfulness; so she called the hare and said to her, &quot;You
are a swift runner. Take this message to the men over yonder: ‘As I dying live
again, so you will dying live again.'&quot; So off the hare started, but in her
great haste she forgot the message, and as she did not wish to show the Moon
that she had forgotten, she delivered the message to men in this way, &quot;As
I dying live again, so you dying will die for ever.&quot; Such was the message
delivered by the hare. In the meantime the tortoise had remembered the message,
and he started off a second time. &quot;This time,&quot; said he to himself,
&quot;I won't forget.&quot; He came to the place where the men were, and he
delivered his message. When the men heard it they were very angry with the
hare, who was sitting at some distance. She was nibbling the grace after her
race. On of the men ran and lifted a stone and threw it at the hare. It struck
her right in the mouth and cleft her upper lip; hence the lip has been cleft
ever since. That is why every hare has a cleft upper lip to this day, and that
is the end of the story. [Rev. S. S. Dornan, &quot;The Tati Bushmen (Masarwas)
and their Language,&quot; Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute,
xlvii. (1917) p. 80).]</p>

<h4>Louyi story of the origin of death: the sun and moon, the chameleon and
the hare.</h4>

<p>In a story told by the A-Louyi tribe of the
Upper Zambesi, the messengers of death and of life respectively are the
chameleon and the hare. They say that Nyambe, whom they identify with the sun,
used to dwell on earth with his wife Nasilele, whom they identify with the
moon. But Nyambe retired to heaven from fear of men. Whenever he carved wood,
men carved it also; when he made a wooden plate, so did they. After he had
withdrawn to the sky, it happened that Nyambe's dog died. He loved the animal,
and said, &quot;Let the dog live.&quot; But his wife said, &quot;No, I won't
have it. He's a thief.&quot; Nyambe still persisted. &quot;For my part,&quot;
said he, &quot;I love my dog.&quot; But his wife said, &quot;Throw him
out.&quot; So they threw him out. By and by Nyambe's mother-in-law died, and
his wife said to him, &quot;Let her live,&quot; just as Nyambe himself had said
to her about his dog. But Nyambe answered, &quot;No, let her die and be done
with it. I said to you that my dog should live, and you refused. It is my wish
that you mother should die for good and all.&quot; So die she did for good and
all. After that the husband and wife sent two messengers, a chameleon and a
hare, to men on the earth. To the chameleon they said, &quot;When thou art come
to men, say to them, ‘Ye shall live'; but as for thee, O hare, when thou art
come to men, say to them, ‘Ye shall die once for all.'&quot; The chameleon and
the hare set off with their messages. Now the chameleon, as he went, kept
constantly turning about, but the hare ran. So the hare arrived first, and said
that men should die once for all. Having delivered his message, the hare
returned. That is why, when men die, they die once for all [Footnote: E.
Jacottet, Etudes sur les langues du Haut-Zambeze, Troisieme Partie, Textes
Louyi (Paris, 1901), pp. 116 sq. As to the identification of Nyambe and
Nasilele with the sun and moon respectively, see E. Jacottet, op. Cit. P. 118,
note 3.]. From this Louyi legend it would appear that human mortality resulted
from a domestic jar in heaven, the deity falling out with his wife over his
dead dog and mother-in-law. From such seemingly trivial causes may flow such
momentous consequences.</p>

<h4>Ekoi story of the origin of death: God, the frog and the duck.</h4>

<p>The Ekoi of Southern Nigeria, on the border
of the Cameroons, attribute human mortality to the gross misconduct of a duck.
It happened in this way. The sky-god Obassi Osaw one day thought to himself,
&quot;Men fear to die. They do not know that perhaps they may come to life
again. I will tell them that sometimes such a thing may happen, then they will
have less dread of death.&quot; So he stood up in his house in the sky, and
called a frog and a duck before him. To the frog he said, &quot;Go to earth and
say to the people, ‘When a man dies, it is the end of all things; he shall
never live again.'&quot; To the duck he said, &quot;Go tell the earth folk that
if a man dies he may come to life again.&quot; He then led them a little way
and showed them the road, saying, &quot;Take my message. Duck, you may go to
the left hand. Frog, keep to the right.&quot; So the frog kept on to the right,
and when he came to the earth he delivered his message of death to the first
men he met, telling them that when they died it would be an end of them. In due
time the duck also reached the earth, but happening to arrive at a place where
the people were making palm oil, she fell to gobbling it up and forgot all about
the message of immortality which the good god had charged her to deliver to
mankind. That is why we are all mortal down to this day. We are bound to go by
the message of the frog; we cannot go by the message of the duck,, which never
reached us. [Footnote: P. Amaury Talbot, In the Shadow of the Bush (London,
1912) p. 229.]</p>

<h4>Gold Coast story of the origin of death: God, the sheep, and the goat.</h4>

<p>The story of the two messengers is related
also by the negroes of the Gold Coast, and in their version the two messengers
are a sheep and a goat. The following is the form in which the tale was told by
a native to a Swiss missionary at Akropong. In the beginning, when sky and
earth existed, but there were as yet no men on earth, there fell a great rain,
and soon after it had ceased a great chain was let down from heaven to earth
with seven men hanging on it. These men had been created by God, and they
reached the earth by means of the chain. They brought fire with them and cooked
their food at it. Not long afterwards God sent a goat from heaven to deliver
the following message to the seven men, &quot;There is something that is called
Death; it will one day kill some of you; but though you die, you will not
perish utterly, but you will come to me here in heaven.&quot; The goat went his
way, but when he came near the town he lit on a bush which seemed to him good
to eat; so he lingered there and began to browse. When God saw that the goat
lingered by the way, he sent a sheep to deliver the same message. The sheep
went, but did not say what God had commanded her to say; for she perverted the
message and said, &quot;When you once die, you perish, and have no place to go
to.&quot; Afterwards the goat came and said, &quot;God says, you will die, it
is true, but that will not be the end of you, for you will come to me.&quot;
But the men answered, &quot;No, goat, God did not say that to you. What the
sheep first reported, by that we shall abide.&quot; [Footnote: J. G.
Christaller, &quot;Negersagen von der Goldkuste,&quot; Zeitschrift fur
Afrikanische Sprachen, i. (Berlin, 1887-88) p. 55.] In another version of the
story, also told at Akropong, the parts of the goat and the sheep are inverted;
it is the sheep that bears the good tidings and loiters by the way to browse,
and it is the goat that bears the evil tidings, and is the first to deliver
them. The story ends with the melancholy reflection that &quot;if only the
sheep had made good speed with her message, man would have died but returned
after death; but the goat made better speed with the contrary message, so man
returns no more.&quot; [Footnote: J. G. Christaller, op. cit. P. 58.]</p>

<h4>Ashantee story of the origin of death: God, the sheep, and the goat.</h4>

<p>In an Ashantee version of the story the two
messengers are also a sheep and a goat, and the perversion of the message of
immortality is ascribed sometimes to the one animal and sometimes to the other.
The ashantees say that long ago men were happy, for God dwelt among them and
talked with them face to face. However, these blissful days did not last for
ever. One unlucky day it chanced that some women were pounding a mash with
pestles in a mortar, while God stood by looking on. For some reason they were
annoyed by the presence of the deity and told him to be off; and as he did not
take himself off fast enough to please them, they beat him with their pestles.
In a great huff God retired altogether from the world and left it to the
direction of the fetishes; and still to this day people say, &quot;Ah, if it
had not been for that old woman, how happy we should be!&quot; However, God was
very good-natured, and even after he had gone up aloft, he sent a kind message
by a goat to men on earth, saying, &quot;There is something which they call
Death. He will kill some of you. But even if you die, you will not perish
completely. You will come to me in heaven.&quot; So off the goat set with this
cheering intelligence. But before he came to the town, he saw a tempting bush
by the wayside, and stopped to browse on it. When God looked down from heaven
and saw the goat loitering by the way, he sent off a sheep with the same message
to carry the joyful news to men without delay. But the sheep did not give the
message aright. Far from it: she said, &quot;God sends you word that you will
die, and that will be an end of you.&quot; When the goat had finished his meal,
he also trotted into the town and delivered his message, saying, &quot;God
sends you word that you will die, certainly, but that will not be the end of
you, for you will go to him.&quot; But men said to the goat, &quot;No, goat,
that is not what God said. We believe that the message which the sheep brought
us is the one which God sent to us.&quot; That unfortunate misunderstanding was
the beginning of death among men. [Footnote: E. Perregaux, Chez les Achanti
(Neuchatel, 1906) pp. 198 sq.] However, in another Ashantee version of the tale
the parts played by the sheep and goat are reversed. It is the sheep who brings
the tidings of immortality from God to men, but the goat overruns him, and
offers them death instead. In their innocence men accepted death with
enthusiasm, not knowing what it was, and naturally they have died ever since.
[Footnote: E. Perregaux, op. cit. P. 199). </p>

<p>In a version of the story which is told by
the Akamba of British East Africa the two gospel messengers are a chameleon and
a thrush, whom God sent out together to find people who died one day and came
to life the next, and to bear the glad tidings of immortality to men. So off
they set, the chameleon leading the way, for in those days he was a very high
and mighty person indeed. As they went along, what should they see but some
people lying like dead by the wayside. The Chameleon went up to them and said
softly, &quot;Niwe, niwe, niwe.&quot; But the thrush asked him testily what he
was making that noise for. The chameleon mildly answered, &quot;I am only
calling the people who go forward and then come back,&quot; and he explained to
the thrush that these seemingly dead folk would rise from the dead, just as he
himself in walking lurches backward and forward before he takes a step. This argument
from analogy, which might have satisfied a Butler, had no effect on the
sceptical thrush. He derided the idea of the resurrection. Undeterred by this
blatant infidelity the chameleon persisted in calling to the dead people, and
sure enough they opened their eyes and listened to him. But the thrush rudely
interrupted him and told the dead people that dead they were and dead they
would remain, nothing could bring them to life. With that he flew away, and
though the chameleon stayed behind and preached to the corpses, telling them
that he had come from God on purpose to bring them to life again, and that they
were not to believe the lies of that shallow sceptic the thrush, they turned a
deaf ear to his message; not one of those dead corpses would so much as budge.
So the chameleon returned crestfallen to God and reported the failure of his
mission, telling him how, when he preached the glad tidings of resurrection to
the corpses, the thrush had roared him down, so that the corpses could not hear
a word he said. Thereupon God cross-questioned the thrush, who stated that the
chameleon had so bungled the message that he, the thrush, felt it to be his
imperative duty to interrupt him. The simple-minded deity believed the lying
thrush, and being very angry with the honest chameleon he degraded him from his
high position and made him walk very slow, lurching this way and that, as he
does down to this very day. But the thrush he promoted to the office of
wakening men from their slumber every morning, which he still does punctually
at 2 A.M. before the note of any other bird is heard in the tropical forest.
[Footnote: C. W. Hobley, Ethnology of A-Kamba and other East African Tribes
(Cambridge, 1910), pp. 107-109. The bird's native name is <em>itoroko</em> or <em>siotoroka</em>.
It is a small bird of the thrush tribe (<em>Cossypha imolaens</em>), with a black
head, bluish-black back, and a buff-coloured breast. Its Luganda name is <em>nyonza</em>
and its Swahili name <em>kurumbizi</em>.]</p>

<h4>Togoland story of the origin of death: God, the dog, and the frog.</h4>

<p>In all these versions of the story the
message is sent from God to men, but in another version, reported from men to
God. They say that once upon a time men sent a dog to God to say that when they
died they would like to come to life again. So off the dog trotted to deliver
the message. But on the way he felt hungry and turned into a house, where a man
was boiling magic herbs. So the dog sat down and though to himself, &quot;He is
cooking food.&quot; Meantime the frog had set off to tell God that when men
died they would prefer not to come to life again. Nobody had asked him to give
that message; it was a piece of pure officiousness and impertinence on his
part. However, away he tore. The dog, who still sat hopefully watching the
hell-broth brewing, saw him hurrying past the door, but he thought to himself,
&quot;when I have had something to eat, I will soon catch froggy up.&quot;
However, froggy came in first, and said to the deity, &quot;When men die, they
would prefer not to come to life again.&quot; After that, up comes the dog, and
says he, &quot;When men die, they would like to come to life again.&quot; God
was naturally puzzled, and said to the dog, &quot;I really do not understand
these two messages. As I heard the frog's request first, I will comply with it.
I will not do what you said.&quot; That is the reason why men die and do not
come to life again. If the frog had only minded his own business instead of
meddling with other people's, the dead would all have come to life again to
this day. But frogs come to life again when it thunders at the beginning of the
rainy season, after they have been dead all the dry season while the Harmattan
wind was blowing. The, while the rain falls and the thunder peals, you may hear
them quacking in the marshes. [Footnote: Fr. Muller, &quot;Die Religionen Togos
in Einzeldarstellungen,&quot; Anthropos, ii, (1907) p. 203.] Thus we see that
the frog had his own private ends to serve in distorting the message. He gained
for himself the immortality of which he robbed mankind.</p>

<h4>Calabar story of the origin of death: God, the dog, and the sheep.</h4>

<p>In Calabar a somewhat different version of
the same widespread story is told. The messengers are a dog and a sheep, and
they go backwards and forwards between God and men. They say that for a long
time after the creation of the world there was no death in it. At last,
however, a man sickened and died. So the people sent a dog to God to ask him
what they should do with the dead man. The dog stayed so long away that the
people grew tired of waiting and sent off a sheep to God with the same
question. The sheep soon returned, and reported that God said, &quot;Let the
dead man be buried.&quot; So they buried him. Afterwards the dog returned also
and reported that God said, &quot;Put warm ashes on the dead man's belly, and
he will rise again.&quot; However, the people told the dog that he came too
late; the dead man was already buried according to the instructions of the
sheep. That is why men are buried when they die. But as for the dog, he is
driven from men and humiliated, because it is through his fault that we all
die. [Footnote: &quot;Calabar Stories,&quot; Journal of the African Society,
No. 18 (January 1906), p. 194.]</p>

<h4>Bantu story of the origin of death: God, the chameleon, and the lizard.</h4>

<p>In these stories the origin of death is
ascribed to the blunder or willful deceit of one of the two messengers.
However, according to another version of the story, which is widely current
among the Bantu tribes of Africa; death was caused not by the fault of the
messenger, but by the vacillation of God himself, who, after deciding to make
men immortal, changed his mind and resolved to make or leave them mortal; and
unluckily for mankind the second messenger, who bore the message of death,
overran the first messenger, who bore the message of immortality. In this form
of the tale the chameleon figures as the messenger of life, and the lizard as
the messenger of death. Thus the Zulus say that in the beginning Unkulunkulu,
that is, the Old Old One, sent the chameleon to men with a message, saying,
&quot;Go, chameleon, go and say, Let not men die.&quot; The chameleon set out,
but it crawled very slowly and loitered by the way to eat the purple berries of
the <em>ubukwebezane</em> shrub or of a mulberry tree; however, some people say
that it climbed up a tree to bask in the sun, filled its belly with flies, and
fell fast asleep. Meantime the Old Old One had thought better of it and sent a
lizard post-haste after the chameleon with a very different message to men, for
he said to the animal, &quot;Lizard, when you have arrived, say, Let men
die.&quot; So the lizard ran, passed the dawdling chameleon, and arriving first
among men delivered his message of death, saying, &quot;Let men die.&quot; Then
he turned and went back to the Old Old One who had sent him. But after he was
gone, the chameleon at last arrived among men with his joyful news of immortality,
and he shouted, saying, &quot;It is said, Let not men die!&quot; But men
answered, &quot;Oh! We have heard the word of the lizard; it has told us the
word, ‘It is said, Let men die.' We cannot hear your word. Through the word of
the lizard, men will die.&quot; And died they have ever since from that day to
this. So the Zulus hate the lizard and kill it whenever they can, for they say,
&quot;This is the very piece of deformity which ran in the beginning to say
that men should die.&quot; But others hate and hustle or kill the chameleon,
saying, &quot;That is the little thing which delayed to tell the people that
they should not die. If he had only told us in time, we too should not have
died; our ancestors also would have been still living; there would have been no
diseases here on earth. It all comes from the delay of the chameleon.&quot;

(Springvale Natal, etc., 1868) pp. I, 3 sq., Part ii. (Springvale, Natal, etc.,

lizard is hated much more than the chameleon and is invariably killed. On the
other hand, according to Arbousset and Daumas, it was the grey lizard that
brought the message of life, and the chameleon that brought the message of
death; hence the chameleon is hated, but the harmless grey lizard beloved.</p>

<h4>Wide diffusion of this story of the chameleon and the lizard.</h4>

<p>The same story is told in nearly the same
form by other Bantu tribes such as the Bechuanas [Footnote: J. Chapman, <em>Travels
in the Interior of South Africa</em> (lLondon, 1868), i. 47.], the Basutos [E.
Casalis, <em>The Basutos</em> (London, 1861), p. 242; E. Jacottet, <em>The
Treasury of Ba-suto Lore</em>, i. (Morija, Basutoland, 1908) pp. 46 sqq.
According to the Basutos it was the grey lizard that was sent first with the
message of immortality, and the chameleon that was sent after him with the
message of mortality. Compare above, p. 64, note.], the Baronga [Footnote:
Henri A. Junod, <em>Les Chants et les Contes des Ba-ronga</em> (Lausanne, N.D.),
p. 137; <em>id., Les Ba-Ronga</em> (Neuchatel, 1898), pp. 401 sq.; is., <em>The
Life of a South African Tribe</em> (Neuchatel, 1912-1913), ii. 328 sq.], the
Ngoni [Footnote: W. A. Elmslie, <em>Among the Wild </em>Ngonii (Edinburgh and
London, 1899), p. 70], and apparently by the Wa-Sania of British East Africa [Footnote:
See Captain W. E. R. Barrett, &quot;Notes on the Customs and Beliefs of the
Wa-giriama, etc., of British East Africa,&quot; <em>Journal of the Royal
Anthropological Institute</em>, xli. (1911) p. 37, &quot;The Wa-Sania believe
that formerly human beings did not die until one day a lizard (Dibleh) appeared
and said to them, ‘All of you now that the moon dies and rises again, but human
beings will die and rise no more.' They say that from that day human beings
commenced to die.&quot; This is probably only an abridged form of the story of
the two messages sent to man by the Moon through the lizard and the
chameleon.]. If is found, in a slightly altered form, even among the Hausas,
who are not a Bantu people [Footnote: J. G. Christaller, &quot;Negersagen von
der Goldkuste,&quot; <em>Zeitschrift fur Afrikanische Sprachen</em>, i. (Berlin,
1887-1888) p. 61. In this Hausa version the message sent by God to men through
the chameleon is as follows, &quot;when a man dies, you must touch him with
bread, and he will rise again.&quot; This message the chameleon faithfully
delivered, but men refused to accept it, because the lizard, outrunning the
chameleon, had brought them this word, &quot;when &quot; man dies, you must
bury him.&quot;]. To this day the Baronga and the Ngoni owe the chameleon a
grudge for having brought death into the world by its dilatoriness. Hence, when
they find a chameleon slowly climbing on a tree, they tease it till it opens
its mouth, whereupon they throw a pinch of tobacco on its tongue, and watch
with delight the creature writhing and changing colour from orange to green,
from green to black in the agony of death; for so they avenge the great wrong
which the chameleon did to mankind [Footnote: H. A. Junod and W. A. Elmslie, <em>llcc</em>.;
see above, notes 3 and 4. The particular species of lizard which according to the
Thonga (Baronga) outran the chameleon and brought the message of death, is a
large animal with a blue head.].</p>

<h4>The fatal miscarriage.</h4>

<p>Thus the belief is widespread in Africa, that
God at one time purposed to make mankind immortal, but that the benevolent
scheme miscarried through the fault of the messenger to whom he had entrusted
the gospel message.</p>

<h3>The Story of the Cast Skin</h3>

<h4>Savage belief that animals which cast their skins renew their youth and
never die.</h4>

<p>Many savages believe that, in virtue of the
power of periodically casting their skins, certain animals and in particular
serpents renew their youth and never die. Holding this belief, they tell
stories to explain how it came about that these creatures obtained, and men
missed, the boon of immortality.</p>

<h4>Various stories of how men missed the gift of immortality and serpents and lizards
obtained it.</h4>

<p>Thus, for example, the Wafipa and Wabende of
East Africa say that one day God, whom they name Leza, came down to earth, and
addressing all living creatures said, &quot;Who wishes not to die?&quot;
Unfortunately man and the other animals were asleep; only the serpent was awake
and he promptly answered, &quot;I do.&quot; That is why en and all other
animals die. The serpent alone does not die of himself. He only dies if he is
killed. Every year he changes his skin and so renews his youth and his strength
[Footnote: Mgr. Lechaptois, <em>Aux Rives du Tanganika</em> (Algiers, 1913), p.
195.]. In like manner the Dusuns of British North Borneo say that when the
Creator had finished making all things, he asked, &quot;Who is able to cast off
his skin? If any one can do so, he shall not die.&quot; The snake alone heard
and answered, &quot;I can.&quot; For that reason down to the present day the
snake does not die unless he is killed by man. The Dusuns did not hear the Creator's
question, or they also would have thrown off their skins., and there would have
been no death [Footnote: Ivor H. N. Evans, &quot;Folk Stories of the Tempassuk
and Tuaran Districts, British North Borneo,&quot; <em>Journal of the royal
Anthropological Institute</em>, xliii. (1913) p. 478.] Similarly the
Todjo-Toradjas of Central Celebes relate that once upon a time God summoned men
and animals for the purpose of determining their lot. Among the various lots
proposed by the deity was this, &quot;We shall put off our old skin.&quot;
Unfortunately mankind on this momentous occasion was represented by an old
woman in her dotage, who did not hear the tempting proposal. But the animals
which slough their skins, such as serpents and shrimps, heard it and closed
with the offer [Footnote: N. Adriani en Alb. C. Kruijt, <em>De Bare'e-sprekende
Toradja's van Midden-Celebes </em>(Batavia, 1912-1914), ii. 83.]. Again, the
natives of Vuatom, an island in the Bismarck Archipelago, say that a certain To
Konokonomiange bade two lads fetch fire, promising that if they did so they
should never die, but that, if they refused, their bodies would perish, though
their shades or souls would survive. They would not hearken to him, so he
cursed them, saying, &quot;What! You would all have lived! Now you shall die,
though your soul shall live. But the iguana (<em>Goniocephalus</em>) and the
lizard (<em>Varanus indicus</em>) and the snake (<em>Enygrus</em>), they shall
live, they shall cast their skin and they shall live for evermore.&quot; When
the lads heard that, they wept, for bitterly they rued their folly in not going
to fetch the fire for To Konokonomiange [Footnote: Otto Meyer, &quot;Mythen und
Erzahlungen von der Insel Vuatom (Bismarck-Archipel, Sudsee),&quot; <em>Anthropos</em>,
v. (1910) p. 724.].</p>

<h4>South American stories of how men missed the gift of immortality, and serpents,
lizards, and beetles obtained it.</h4>

<p>The Arawaks of British Guiana relate that
once upon a time the Creator came down to earth to see how his creature man was
getting on. But men were so wicked that they tried to kill him; so he deprived
them of eternal life and bestowed it on the animals which renew their skin,
such as serpents, lizards, and beetles [Footnote: R. Schomburgk, <em>Reisen in
Britisch-Guiana</em> (Leipsic, 1847-1848), ii. 319.]. A somewhat different
version of the story is told by the Tamanachiers, an Indian tribe of the
Orinoco. They say that after residing among them for some time the Creator took
boat to cross to the other side of the great salt water from which he had come.
Just as he was shoving off from the shore, he called out to them in a changed
voice, &quot;You will change your skins,&quot; by which he meant to say,
&quot;You will renew your youth like the serpents and the beetles.&quot; But
unfortunately an old woman, hearing these words, cried out &quot;Oh!&quot; in a
tone of scepticism, if not of sarcasm, which so annoyed the Creator that he
changed his tune at once and said testily, &quot;Ye shall die.&quot; That is
why we are all mortal [Footnote: R. Schomburgk, op. cit. iI. 320.].</p>

<h4>Niasian story of how men missed the gift of immortality, and serpents
obtained it.</h4>

<p>The people of Nias, an island to the west of
Sumatra, say that, when the earth was created, a certain being was sent down
from above to put the finishing touches to the work. He ought to have fasted,
but, unable to withstand the pangs of hunger, he ate some bananas. The choice
of food was very unfortunate, for had he only eaten river crabs, men would have
cast their skins like crabs, and so, renewing their youth perpetually, would
never have die. As it is, death has come upon us all through the eating of
those bananas [Footnote: H. Sundermann, <em>Die Insel Nias und die Mission
daselbst</em> (Barmen, 1905), p. 68; E. Modigliani, <em>Un viaggio a Nias</em>
(Milan, 1890), p. 295.]. Another version of the Niasian story adds that
&quot;the serpents on the contrary ate the crabs, which in the opinion of the
people of Nias cast their skins but do not die; therefore serpents also do not
die but merely cast their skin.&quot; [Footnote: A. Fehr, <em>Der Niasser im
Leben und Sterben</em> (Barmen, 1901), p. 8.]</p>

<h4>Samoan story of how men missed the gift of immortality.</h4>

<p>In this last version the immortality of
serpents is ascribed to their having partaken of crabs, which by casting their
skins renew their youth and live for ever. The same belief in the immortality
of shell-fish occurs in a Samoan story of the origin of death. They say that
the gods met in council to determine what should be the end of man. One
proposal was that men should cast their skins like shellfish, and so renew
their youth. The god Palsy moved, on the contrary, that shellfish should cast
their skins, but that men should die. While the motion was still before the
meeting a shower of rain unfortunately interrupted the discussion, and as the
gods ran to take shelter, the motion of Palsy was carried unanimously. That is
why shellfish still cast their skins and men do not [Footnote: George Brown,
D.D., <em>Melanesians and Polynesians</em> (London, 1910), p. 365; George Turner,
<em>Samoa a Hundred Years ago and long before</em> (London, 1884), pp. 8 sq.]</p>

<h4>Some people believe that formerly men cast their skins and lived for ever.</h4>

<p>Thus not a few peoples appear to believe that
the happy privilege of immortality, obtainable by the simple process of
periodically shedding the skin, was once within reach of our species, but that
through an unhappy chance it was transferred to certain of the lower creatures,
such as serpents, crabs, lizards, and beetles. According to others, however,
men were at one time actually in possession of this priceless boon, but
forfeited it through the foolishness of an old woman.</p>

<h4>Melanesian story of how men ceased to renew their youth by casting their
skins.</h4>

<p>Thus the Melanesians of the Banks' Islands
and the New Hebrides say that at first men never died, but that when they
advanced in life they cast their skins like snakes and crabs, and came out with
youth renewed. After a time a woman, growing old, went to a stream to change
her skin; according to some, she was the mother of the mythical or legendary
hero Qat, according to others, she was Ul-ta-marama, Change-skin of the world.
She threw off her old skin in the water, and observed that as it floated down
it caught against a stick. Then she went home, where she had left her child.
But the child refused to recognize her, crying that its mother was an old
woman, not like this young stranger. So to pacify the child she went after her
cast integument and put it on. From that time mankind ceased to cast their
skins and died [Footnote: R. H. Codrington, <em>the Melanesians</em> (Oxford,
1891), p. 265; W. Gray, &quot;Some Notes on the Tannese,&quot; <em>Internationales
Archiv fur Ethnographie</em>, vii. (1894) p. 232].</p>

<h4>A similar story of the origin of death told by the Kai of New Guinea.</h4>

<p>A similar story of the origin of death is
told in the Shortlands Islands [Footnote: C. Ribbe, <em>Zwei Jahre unter den
Kannibalen der Salomo-Inseln</em> (Dresden-Blasowitz, 1903), p. 148] and by the
Kai, a Papuan tribe of north-eastern New Guinea. The Kai say that at first men
did not die but renewed their youth. When their old brown skin grew wrinkled
and ugly, they stepped into water, and stripping it off got a new, youthful
white skin instead. In those days there lived an old grandmother with her
grandchild. One day the old woman, weary of her advanced years, bathed in the
river, cast off her withered old hide, and returned to the village, spick and
span, in a fine new skin. Thus transformed, she climbed up the ladder and
entered her house. But when her grandchild saw her, he wept and squalled, and
refused to believe that she was his granny. All her efforts to reassure and
pacify him proving vain, she at last went back in a rage to the river, fished
her wizened old skin out of the water, put it on, and returned to the house a
hideous old hag again. The child was glad to see his granny come back, but she
said to him, &quot;The locusts cast their skins, but ye men shall die from this
day forward.&quot; And sure enough, they have done so ever since [Footnote: Ch.
Keysser, &quot;Aus dem Leben der Kaileute,&quot; in R. Neuhass's <em>Deutsch
Neu-Guinea</em> (Berlin, 1911), iii. 161 sq.]</p>

<h4>Similar story told by the natives of the Admiralty Islands</h4>

<p>The same story, with some trivial variations,
is told by natives of the Admiralty Islands. They say that once on a time there
was an old woman, and she was frail. She had two sons, and they went a-fishing,
while she herself went to bathe. She stripped off her wrinkled old skin and
came forth as young as she had been long ago. When her sons came from the
fishing they were astonished to see her. The one said, &quot;It is our
mother&quot;; but the other said, &quot;She may be your mother, but she shall
be my wife.&quot; Their mother overheard them and said, &quot;What were you two
saying?&quot; The two said, &quot;Nothing! We only said that you are our
mother.&quot; &quot;You are liars,&quot; she retorted, &quot;I heard you both.
If I had had my way, we should have grown to be old men and women, and then we
should have cast our skin and been young men and young women. But you have had
your way. We shall grow old men and old women, and then we shall die.&quot;
With that she fetched her old skin, and put it on, and became an old woman
again. As for us, her descendants, we grow up and we grow old. But if it had
not been for those two young scapegraces, there would have been no end of our
days, we should have lived for ever and ever [Footnote: Josef Meier,
&quot;Mythen und Sagen der Admiralitatsinsulaner,&quot; <em>Anthropos</em>, iii.
(1908) p. 193.].</p>

<h4>A similar story of the origin of death told by a tribe in Celebes.</h4>

<p>Still farther away from the Banks Islands the
very same story is repeated by the To Koolawi, a mountain tribe of Central
Celebes. As reported by the Dutch missionaries who discovered it, the Celebes
version of this widely diffused tale runs thus. In the olden time men had, like
serpents and shrimps, the power of casting their skin, whereby they became
young again. Now there was an old woman who had a grandchild. Once upon a time
she went to the water to bathe, and thereupon laid aside her old skin and hung
it up on a tree. With her youth quite restored she returned to the house. But
her grandchild did not know her again, and would have nothing to do with his
grandmother; he kept on saying, &quot;You are not my grandmother; my
grandmother was old, and you are young.&quot; Then the woman went back to the
water and drew on her old skin again. But ever since that day men have lost the
power of renewing their youth and must die [Footnote: N. Adriani en Alb. C.
Kruijt, <em>De Bare'e-sprekende Toradja's van Midden-Celebes</em> (Batavia,
1912-1914), ii. 83.].</p>

<h4>A variant of the Melanesian story.</h4>

<p>A variant of the Melanesian story is told in
Aneityum, one of the New Hebrides. There they say that once an old man took off
his skin before he began to work in his garden. He then looked young. But one
day his two grandchildren, finding his skin folded away, pierced it through,
making many holes therein. When the old man put it on again he shivered with
cold, and seeing the holes in his skin he said to his grandchildren, &quot;I
thought we should live for ever and cast our skins and become young again; but
as you have done this we shall all die.&quot; Thus death came into the world
[Footnote: William Gunn, <em>The Gospel in Futuna</em> (London, 1914), pp. 217
sq.].</p>

<h4>A different Melanesian story of the origin of death.</h4>

<p>Another Melanesian tradition ascribes the
introduction of death to purely economic causes. In the days when men changed
their skins and lived for ever, the permanence of property in the same hands
was found to be a great inconvenience; it bore very hard on the heirs, who were
perpetually tantalized by the prospect of an inheritance to which it was
legally and physically impossible that they should ever succeed. All this time
Death had resided either in a shadowy underground region called Panoi or by the
side of a volcanic vent in Santa Maria, it is not quite certain which; but now
in answer to the popular demand he was induced to come abroad and show himself.
He was treated to a handsome funeral of the usual sort; that is to say, he was
laid out on a board and covered with a pall, a pig was killed, and the mourners
enjoyed a funeral feast and divided the property of the deceased. Afterwards,
on the fifth day, the conch shell was blown to drive away the ghost. In short,
nothing was left undone to soothe and gratify the feelings of the departed. So
Death returned down the road to the underground region from which he had
emerged; and all mankind have since followed him thither [Footnote: R. H.
Codrington, <em>The Melanesians</em> (Oxford, 1891), pp. 265 sq.].</p>

<h4>Some peoples believe that men on earth used to rise from the dead after
three days, as the moon appears to do in the sky.</h4>

<p>While some peoples have supposed that in the
early ages of the world men were immortal in virtue of periodically casting
their skins, others have ascribed the same high privilege to a certain lunar
sympathy, in consequence of which mankind passed through alternate states of
growth and decay, of life and death, corresponding to the phases of the moon,
without ever coming to an end. On this view, though death in a sense actually
occurred, it was speedily repaired by resurrection, generally, it would seem,
by resurrection after three days, since three days is the period between the
disappearance of the old moon and the reappearance of the new. Thus the Mentras
or Mantras, a shy tribe of savages in the jungles of the Malay Peninsula,
allege that in the early ages of the world men did not die, but only grew thin
at the waning of the moon and then waxed fat again as she waxed to the full.
Thus there was no check whatever on the population, which increased to an
alarming extent. So a son of the first man brought this state of things to his
father's notice, and asked him what was to be done. The first man, a good easy
soul, said, &quot;Leave things as they are&quot;; but his younger brother, who
took a more Malthusian view of the matter, said, &quot;No, let men die like the
banana, leaving their offspring behind.&quot; The question was submitted to the
Lord of the Underworld, and he decided in favour of death. Ever since then men
have ceased to renew their youth like the moon and have died like the banana
[Footnote: D. F. A. Hervey, &quot;the Mentra Traditions,&quot; <em>Journal of
the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society</em>, No. 10 (December, 1882),
p. 190; W. W. Skeat and C. O. Blagden, <em>Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula</em>
(London, 1906), ii. 337 sq.]. In the Caroline Islands it is said that in the
olden time death was unknown, or rather it was only a short sleep. Men died on
the last day of the waning moon and came to life again on the appearance of the
new moon, just as if they had wakened from a refreshing slumber. But an evil
spirit somehow contrived that when men slept the sleep of death they should
wake no more [Footnote: <em>Lettres Edifiantes et Curieuses</em>, Nouvelle
Edition, xv. (Paris, 1781) pp. 305 sq.]. The Wotjobaluk, a tribe of
south-eastern Australia, related that when all animals were men and women, some
of them died and the moon used to say, &quot;You up again,&quot; whereupon they
came to life again. But once on a time an old man said, &quot;Let them remain
dead&quot;; and since then nobody has ever come to life again, except the moon,
which still continues to do so down to this very day [Footnote: A. W. Howitt, <em>Native
Tribes of South-East Australia</em> (London, 1904), pp. 428 sq.]. The Unmatjera
and Kaitish, two tribes of central Australia, say that their dead used to be
buried either in trees or underground, and that after three days they regularly
rose from the dead. The Kaitish tell how this happy state of things came to an
end. It was all the fault of a man of the Curlew totem, who found some men of
the Little Wallaby totem in the act of burying a man of that ilk. For some
reason the Curlew man flew into a passion and kicked the corpse into the sea.
Of course after that the dead man could not come to life again, and that is why
nowadays nobody rises from the dead after three days, as everybody used to do
long ago [Footnote: (Sir) Baldwin Spencer and F. J. Gillen, <em>Northern Tribes of
Central Australia</em> (London, 1904), pp. 513 sq.]. Though nothing is said
about the moon in this narrative of the origin of death, the analogy of the
preceding stories makes is probable that the three days, during which the dead
used to lie in the grave, were the three days during which the moon lay
&quot;hid in her vacant interlunar cave.&quot; The Fijians also associated the
possibility, though not the actual enjoyment, of human immortality with the
phases of the moon. They say that of old two gods, the Moon and the Rat,
discussed the proper end of man. The Moon said, &quot;Let him be like me, who
disappear awhile and then live again.&quot; But the Rat said, &quot;Let man die
as a rat dies.&quot; And he prevailed [Footnote: Thomas Williams, <em>Fiji and
the Fijians</em>, Second Edition (London, 1860), i. 205.].</p>

<h4>Upoto story of how men missed the boon of immortality and the Moon
obtained it.</h4>

<p>The Upotos of the Congo tell how men missed
and the Moon obtained the boon of immortality. One day God, whom they cal
Libanza, sent for the people of the moon and the people of the earth. The
people of the moon hastened to the deity, and were rewarded by him for their
alacrity. &quot;Because,&quot; said he, addressing the moon, &quot;thou camest
to me at once when I called thee, though shalt never die. Thou shalt be dead
for but two days each month, and that only to rest thee; and thou shalt return
with greater splendour.&quot; But when the people of the earth at last appeared
before Libanza, he was angry and said to them, &quot;Because you came not at
once to me when I called you, therefore you will die one day and not revive,
except to come to me.&quot; [Footnote: M. Lindeman, <em>Les Upotos</em>
(Brussels, 1906), pp. 23 sq.]</p>

<h4>Bahnar story of how men used to rise from the dead by being buried at
the foot of a certain tree.</h4>

<p>The Bahnars of eastern Cochin China explain
the immortality of primitive man neither by the phases of the moon nor by the
custom of casting the skin, but apparently by the recuperative virtue of a
certain tree. They say that in the beginning, when people died, they used to be
buried at the foot of a tree called Long Blo, and that after a time they always
rose from the dead, not as infants, but as full-grown men and women. So the
earth was peopled very fast, and all the inhabitants formed but one great town under
the presidency of our first parents. In time men multiplied to such an extent
that a certain lizard could not take his walks abroad without somebody treading
on his tail. This vexed him, and the wily creature gave an insidious hint to
the gravediggers. &quot;why bury the dead at the foot of the Long Blo
tree?&quot; said he; &quot;bury them at the foot of Long Khung, and they will
not come to life again. Let them die outright and be done with it.&quot; The
hint was taken, and from that day men have not come to life again [Guerlach,
&quot;Moeurs et Superstitions des sauvages Ba-hnars,&quot; <em>Les Missions
Catholiques</em>, xix. (1887) p. 479.]</p>

<h4>Rivalry for immortality between men and creatures that cast their skins,
such as serpents and lizards.</h4>

<p>In this last story, as in many African tales,
the instrument of bringing death among men is a lizard. We may conjecture that
the reason for assigning the invidious office to a lizard was that this animal,
like the serpent, casts its skin periodically, from which primitive man might
infer, as he infers with regard to serpents that the creature renews its youth
and lives for ever. Thus all the myths which relate how a lizard or a serpent
became the maleficent agent of human mortality may perhaps be referred to an
old idea of a certain jealousy and rivalry between men and creatures which cast
their skins, notably serpents and lizards; we may suppose that in all such
cases a story was told of a contest between man and his animal rivals for the
possession of immortality, a contest in which, whether by mistake or guile, the
victory always remained with the animals, who thus became immortal, while
mankind was doomed to mortality.</p>

<h3>The Composite Story of the Perverted Message and the
Cast Skin</h3>

<h4>Stories which combine the incidents of the perverted message and the cast
skin.</h4>

<h5>Galla story of God and the blue bird.</h5>

<p>In some stories of the origin of death the
incidents of the perverted message and the cast skin are combined. Thus the
Gallas of East Africa attribute the mortality of man and the immortality of
serpents to the mistake or malice of a certain bird which falsified the message
of eternal life entrusted to him by God. The creature which did this great
wrong to our species is a black or dark blue bird, with a white patch on each
wing and a crest on its head. It perches on the tops of trees and utters a
wailing note like the bleating of a sheep; hence the Gallas call I <em>holawaka</em>
or &quot;the sheep of God,&quot; and explain its apparent anguish by the
following tale. Once upon a time God sent that bird to tell men that they
should not die, but that when they grew old and weak they should slip off their
skins and so renew their youth. In order to authenticate the message God gave
the bird a crest to serve as the badge of his high office. Well, off the bird
set to deliver the glad tidings of immortality to man, but he had not gone far
before he fell in with a snake devouring carrion in the path. The bird looked
longingly at the carrion and said to the snake, &quot;Give me some of the meat
and blood, and I will tell you God's message.&quot; &quot;I don't want to hear
it,&quot; said the snake tartly, and continued his meal. But the bird pressed
his so to hear the message that the snake rather reluctantly consented.
&quot;The message,&quot; then said the bird, &quot;is this. When men grow old
they will die, but when you grow old you will cast your skin and renew your
youth.&quot; That is why people grow old and die, but snakes crawl out of their
old skins and renew their youth. But for this gross perversion of the message
God punished the heedless or wicked bird with a painful internal malady,, from
which he suffers to this day; that is why he sits wailing on the tops of trees
[Footnote: Miss A. Wener, &quot;Two Galla Legends,&quot; <em>Man</em>, xiii.
(1913) pp. 90 sq.].</p>

<h5>Melanesian story of To Kambinana and To Korvuvu.</h5>

<p>Again, the Melanesians, who inhabit the coast
of the Gazelle Peninsula in New Britain, say that To Kambinana, the Good
Spirit, loved men and wished to make them immortal. So he called his brother To
Korvuvu and said to him, &quot;Go to men and take them the secret of
immortality. Tell them to cast their skin every year. So will they be protected
from death, for their life will be constantly renewed. But tell the serpents
that they must thenceforth die.&quot; However, To Korvuvu acquitted himself
badly of his task; for he commanded men to die, and betrayed to the serpents
the secret of immortality. Since then all men have been mortal, but the
serpents cast their skins every year and never die [Footnote: P. A.
Kleintitschen, <em>Die Kustenbewohner der Gazellehalbinsel</em> (Hiltrup bei
Munster, N.D.), p. 334.]</p>

<h5>Annamite story of Ngoc hoang and his message to men.</h5>

<p>A similar story of the origin of death is
told in Annam. They say that Ngoc hoang sent a messenger from heaven to men to
say that when they reached old age they should change their skins and live for
ever, but that when serpents grew old they must die. The messenger came down to
earth and said, rightly enough, &quot;When man is old he shall cast his skin;
but when serpents are old they shall die and be laid in coffins.&quot; So far
so good. But unluckily there happened to be a brood of serpents within hearing,
and when they learned the doom pronounced on their kind they fell into a fury
and said to the messenger, &quot;You must say it over again and just the
contrary, or we will bite you.&quot; That frightened the messenger, and he
repeated his message, changing the words thus, &quot;When the serpent is old he
shall cast his skin; but when man is old he shall die and be laid in the
coffin.&quot; That is why all creatures are now subject to death, except the
serpent, who, when he is old, casts his skin and lives forever. [Footnote: A.
Landes, &quot;Contes et Legendes Annamites,&quot; <em>Cochinchine francaise,
Excursions et Reconnaissances</em>, No. 25 (Saigon, 1886) pp. 108 sq.]</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<h4>In its original form the Hebrew story of the Fall of Man probably
related how the serpent, by eating of the Tree of Life, obtained the boon of
immortality for his species.</h4>

<p>Thus, arguing from the analogy of the moon or
of animals which cast their skins, the primitive philosopher has inferred that
in the beginning a perpetual renewal of youth was either appointed by a
benevolent being for the huan species or was actually enjoyed by them, and that
but for a crime, an accident, or a blunder it would have been enjoyed by them
for ever. People who pin their faith in immortality to the cast skins of
serpents, lizards, beetles, and the like, naturally look on these animals as
the hated rivals who have robbed us of the heritage which God or nature
intended that we should possess; consequently they tell stories to explain how it
came about that such low creatures contrived to oust us from the priceless
possession. Tales of this sort are widely diffused throughout the world, and it
would be no matter for surprise to find them among the Semites. The story of
the Fall of Man in the third chapter of genesis appears to be an abridged
version of this savage myth. Little is wanted to complete its resemblance to
the similar myths still told by savages in many parts of the world. The
principal, almost the only, omission is the silence of the narrator as to the
eating of the fruit of the tree of life by the serpent, and the consequent
attainment of immortality by the reptile. Nor is it difficult to account for
the lacuna. The vein of rationalism, which runs through the Hebrew account of
creation and has stripped it of many grotesque features that adorn or disfigure
the corresponding Babylonian tradition, could hardly fail to find a
stumbling-block in the alleged immortality of serpents; and the redactor of the
story in its final form has removed this stone of offence from the path of the
faithful by the simple process of blotting out the incident entirely from the
legend. Yet the yawning gap left by his sponge has not escaped the
commentators, who look in vain for the part which should have been played in
the narrative by the tree of life. If my interpretation of the story is right,
it has been left for the comparative method, after thousands of years, to
supply the blank in the ancient canvas, and to restore, in all their primitive
crudity, the gay barbaric colours which the skilful hand of the Hebrew artist
had softened or effaced.</p>

<p>Return to Sodom and Gomorrah, Avon Books: New York, 1994, pp 51-53. (ISBN 0-380-72633-5)</p>

<p>&quot;In 4 million B.C. reptiles still held dominion
over the best parts of the Mediterranean world. Slowly, and with crushing
force, a global deterioration of the climate had begun to build giant ice
sheets and to deflect trade winds in odd directions. Rain patterns changed.
Then, as drought swept across east Africa and savannas degenerated into
deserts, the cobras, deadliest of the snakes, found their territory reduced to
a strip of land only twelve miles wide. For more than two million years they
continued to hold sway over a narrow band of palms and tall grasses that
twisted with the Nile through a thousand miles of drifting sand.</p>

<p>Then, as they slid and weaved along paths
that they had used for tens of thousands of generations, as they prospered on
good hunting for mammals gathering around water holes, occupied the limestone
crevices near Karnak, and multiplied into living masses of snakes, a newer,
more terrifying creature came into their world and instantly challenged their
authority.</p>

<p>The toolmakers had no poison glands and could
not strike as quickly as a cobra; but they carried sharpened sticks and could
loop hemp snares at the ends of long poles, and in time they would master fire
and cook cobra meat in their hearths. Charred cobra vertebrae buried in
prehistoric campfires suggest that one of man's first and most symbolic acts in
the Nile Valley was the killing of the snake.</p>

<p>As a symbol of power the cobra would, in ages
to come, be respected above all other creatures of the Nile. Its likeness would
be found on the walls of Thebes, on its altars, and on the headdresses and
golden death masks of pharaohs.</p>

<p>Across the river from Thebes, in the Valley
of the Kings, frescoes in the tomb of Sethos I (Seti) tell a strange story.
Snakes on the wall have been painted with legs and scaly feet. They grin menacingly,
and the accompanying hieroglyphs indicate an ancient knowledge that snakes were
not always without legs. According to the Sethos I inscriptions, &quot;the
serpent's forebears possessed feet.&quot; It seems reasonable to conclude that
the Egyptian priests and scholars must have dissected snakes and that the
vestiges of limbs did not escape notice. Indeed, the builders of Sethos I's
tomb were anatomically correct when they painted hind legs on snakes, precisely
where the remnants of hipbones are located.</p>

<p>The Sethos I inscriptions connect the snake's
ancestors with an evil curse, which was cast upon them for one offense or
another when the world was still very young. The nature of the offense is not
described, but the punishment is clear: Their legs were taken away, and
henceforth they were obliged to crawl upon their bellies.</p>

<p>This is, of course, very reminiscent of God's
punishment of the snake for its deception of man in the Garden of Eden. In
Genesis 3:14 the Lord God says unto the serpent: &quot;Because thou hast done
this, thou art cursed…upon thy belly shalt thou go….&quot;</p>

<p>The Sethos I account of the transformation of
snakes predates the Bible by a thousand years. Not only is it so similar to the
Genesis account as to render a common origin extremely likely (especially when
considered in the light of such additional Egyptian parallels as the four
beasts of the Apocalypse before the biblical Apocalypse), it is surprisingly
faithful to the scientific account of snake origins: They evolved from
four-legged lizardlike ancestors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Again see what the same author [Philo
of Byblos], in his translation from Sanchuniathon about the Phoenician
alphabet, says concerning the reptiles and venomous beasts, which contribute no
good service to mankind, but work death and destruction to any in whom they
inject their incurable and fatal poison. This also he describes, saying word
for word as follows:</p>

<p>‘The nature then of the dragon and of
serpents Tauthus himself regarded as divine, and so again after him did the
Phoenicians and Egyptians: for this animal was declared by him to be of all
reptiles most full of breath, and fiery. In consequence of which it also exerts
an unsurpassable swiftness by means of its breath, without feet and hands or
any other of the external members by which the other animals make their
movements. It also exhibits forms of various shapes, and in its progress makes
spiral leaps as swift as it chooses. It is also most long-lived, and its nature
is to put off its old skin, and so not only to grow young again, but also to
assume a larger growth; and after it has fulfilled its appointed measure of
age, it is self-consumed, in like manner as Tauthus himself has set down in his
sacred books: for which reason this animal has also been adopted in temples and
in mystic rites.</p>

<p>We have spoken more fully about it in the
memoirs entitled Ethothiae, in which we prove that it is immortal, and is
self-consumed, as is stated before: for this animal does not die by a natural
death, but only if struck by a violent blow. The Phoenicians call it &quot;Good
Daemon&quot;: in like manner the Egyptians also surname it Cneph; and they add
to it the head of a hawk because of the hawk's activity.'&quot;</p>

<h1>Developmental basis of limblessness and axial patterning in snakes. </h1>

<p>Nature 1999 Jun 3;399(6735):474-9</p>

<p>Cohn MJ, Tickle C</p>

<p>Division of Zoology, School of Animal and
Microbial Sciences, University of Reading, UK. M.J.Cohn@reading.ac.uk </p>

<p>The evolution of snakes involved major
changes in vertebrate body plan organization, but the developmental basis of
those changes is unknown. The python axial skeleton consists of hundreds of
similar vertebrae, forelimbs are absent and hindlimbs are severely reduced.
Combined limb loss and trunk elongation is found in many vertebrate taxa,
suggesting that these changes may be linked by a common developmental
mechanism. Here we show that Hox gene expression domains are expanded along the
body axis in python embryos, and that this can account for both the absence of
forelimbs and the expansion of thoracic identity in the axial skeleton.
Hindlimb buds are initiated, but apical-ridge and polarizing-region signalling
pathways that are normally required for limb development are not activated. Leg
bud outgrowth and signalling by Sonic hedgehog in pythons can be rescued by
application of fibroblast growth factor or by recombination with chick apical
ridge. The failure to activate these signalling pathways during normal python
development may also stem from changes in Hox gene expression that occurred
early in snake evolution. PMID: 10365960, UI: 99292082</p>
