Cryptoclans rock.

This Perl script takes as input a pipe-delimited file where:

* each line is a puzzle
* the first field is the topic
* each additional field is an item

Try it with family member names, favorite meals, old pets, whatever.  Note that a character might be the same in plaintext and ciphertext.  I may change that later.
